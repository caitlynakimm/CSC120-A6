What are your initial impressions of how `Unit Testing` affects your programming?
What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I think creating tests for the methods in the Engine, Car, and Passenger classes were more understandable for me compared to the Train class. Through unit testing, I think I was able to get a better picture of predicting different edge cases for these classes and how they are related to each other. What didn't work for me was understanding how to create a test for the Train class's printManifest method. It took me a while to understand how to check that the roster and car titles and passenger names from the Train's printManifest method were correctly printed to the console. Advice I would give someone taking this course in the future is to plan ahead on what possible cases/errors each class could run into before writing your tests. 

I created unit tests for each part of the train system. The Engine tests check for correct initialization of fuel type and fuel levels, and confirm that the go() method correctly reduces fuel. Car tests check passenger management, ensuring passengers can be added and removed while keeping track of accurate seat counts. Passenger tests check boarding behavior for both available and full cars. Train tests verify multiple aspects: construction, total passenger count across all cars, specified car retrieval, and manifest print.
